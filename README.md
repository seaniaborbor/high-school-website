# CodeIgniter 4 School Website

Welcome to the CodeIgniter 4 School Website project! This full-stack application is designed to serve as a comprehensive platform for managing a school's online presence. Administrators can log in and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog/news posts, manage team members, handle staff (instructors working with the school), and maintain a list of courses offered by the school.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Administrators can log in securely to access the admin dashboard.

- **Blog/News Management:** Create, edit, view, and delete blog posts to keep the community updated with the latest news and information.

- **Team Management:** Admins can manage the team members who contribute to the website. This could include various roles such as developers, designers, or any other contributors.

- **Staff Management:** Maintain a list of instructors or staff members associated with the school. Update their information as needed.

- **Course Management:** Admins can manage the courses offered by the school. This includes adding new courses, updating existing ones, and removing outdated courses.
