                                        <i>tutorial session for my neighbors and the community kids, including my son in my
                                        Livingroom.</i> I observed that the daily routine of the kids was just to eat and spend
                                        the rest of the day idle, as most parents could not afford to take their kids long

                        <p class="sample-text mb-3">Before the civil conflict, <i>I was a teacher at the J. J. Roberts United Methodist
                        School</i>, so I saw the need to render myself to the community in such a fashion.
                        With Such an idea at such times, other people saw the essence of the endeavor
                        and what I was offering, and they decided to enroll their children. The number
                        grew to 5, then 10 and sooner than later, my living room could not even
                        accommodate the numbers anymore. Due to the growing numbers, I began to
                        break and expand my living room to cater to the increasing number. Because of
                        the increasing costs of maintaining and running the operations of the session, I
                        began to collect a fee of $1 per child for operating expenses.
                        Later on, communication came from above, from neighboring Sierra Leone, from
                        the principal of the J. J. Roberts High School, <b>Mrs. Ruth Yei Wour,</b> to re-open the
                        school for the resumption of enrichment classes. I was contacted and I had to
                        respond to the call of duty. But because I already had my tutorial sessions
                        ongoing and I couldn’t just leave, I decided to train a few people, especially, <i>Bindu
                        Gboyah, Facia Freeman, and Ruth Goba,</i> to take over after me while I was away.</p>

                           


                        <p class="sample-text mb-3"><i>“Realistically, my decision to leave was also influenced by the financial benefit.” </i>Before Departure, the Parents of the kids I taught and who had already adjusted
                        to me became increasingly concerned, and they agreed to increase the fees from
                        a dollar per month to US$ 20 per semester. </p>

                        Leone during Civil War.

                        </div>

                        <p class="sample-text mb-3">In 2001, The National Housing Authority (NHA) ordered that I stop using my
                        residence for school as it was not built for such purpose and was also not safe for
                        the kids. With this unexpected constrain, I managed to strike a deal with the
                        <b>Kimber’s Family</b> to use their compound as my school premises. Then we formally
                        became known as the <b>Christiana Bedell Preparatory School.</b>
                        Subsequently, we set up our Parents and Teachers Association (PTA). The first
                        Chairperson was <b>Cllr. Frances Johnson Allison</b>, former Chief Justice. The second
                        was Mr. Monyenneh Doh and so on.</p>

                        <p class="sample-text mb-3">By the end of 2003, we had 300 students and in the same year, we graduated our
                        first batch with 36 students, some of whom are now renowned Doctors, Lawyers,
                        Engineers, etc. In 2005, The Kimber Family requested that their compound be
                        turned over, this was unexpected and thus, we were stranded. We wrote the
                        national Housing Authority (NHA) to grant us a parcel of land so we can
                        permanently be stationed and stable. The First Managing Director we met was
                        Mr. Dunbar, unfortunately, this encounter yielded no result, but we persisted. In
                        2008, under the leadership of Nahn John Suah, the then Managing Director of
                        NHA, he saw reason and asked the technical department to work along with me
                        to scout for suitable land to build an institution. In the process, the technical team
                        joined us to survey the land that we had found for the construction of the school.
                        An agreement was signed granting us to construct.</p>

                        <p class="sample-text mb-3">With the prevailing plight, where we had insufficient funds left after paying the
                        first lease, having staff to pay, I decided to put-up temporary reed structures to
                        accommodate a portion of the students while the others went back to
                        temporarily use the initial residential structure.</p>

                        <p class="sample-text mb-3">Madam Massa Thompson worked with the ICRC and also had a daughter who was
                        one of the first graduates from the Christiana Bedell Preparatory School. The ICRC
                        granted us rolls of tarpaulin which we used to cover the misshaped buildings we
                        used for classes.</p>

                        <p class="sample-text mb-3">In May 2009, a heavy storm hit Monrovia, breaking down the misshaped buildings
                        and destroying everything we had, including books. Unfortunately, parents began
                        taking their children to other schools. Now with only land available, I began to
                        solicit funds from everywhere possible for a fresh beginning. During normal days,
                        J. J. Roberts High School had lots of Black Americans, through engagements with
                        them, some of them decided to help. I had to sell my properties, friends
                        contributed, and more.</p>

                        <p class="sample-text mb-3">Again, through Madam Massa Thompson, the ICRC stepped in and rendered their
                        helping hand. This time we decided not to erect misshaped structures but rather
                        mud bricks which we obtained from Urban Monrovia, as we learned from a
                        workshop then, that bullets could not penetrate mud blocks. We did the first 6
                        classes with toilets for the children, it was dedicated and they moved in.</p>

                        <p class="sample-text mb-3">Due to the effects of the war, parents persuaded me to open a night session
                        where we would teach the elderly, market men and women, widows and
                        widowers, etc. how to read and write. Not too long after the night session was
                        established, the New Georgia Methodist Church through Pastor Jerry Kula asked
                        me to kindly accommodate two of the students (Emily Sweet and another) from
                        the Mercy Ships, which had arrived on the shores of Monrovia, to live with me
                        and my family, with open arms, I took them in as a family. Seeing how hard I
                        worked and improvised under unbelievable circumstances, Emily Sweet upon her
                        return to the United States, continued to help in unimaginable ways. The night
                        session which had already reached 200 students (men and women) was named in
                        her honor, “The Emily Sweet School of Excellence”, which was later transferred to
                        the Methodist School Compound in the New Georgia Housing Estate by one of the
                        workers.</p>

                        <p class="sample-text mb-3">After so many hurdles, the Christiana Bedell Preparatory School has steadily been
                        growing and improving. As more students were coming in, we erected the second
                        section of the building. We built a computer laboratory, equipped with 54
                        complete sets of computers where we began to distinguish our students by giving
                        them contemporary computer training.
                        As the years went by, we added a class each year, eventually, we now have from
                        pre-school up to 9 th  grade, yet there are strong appeals for us to extend the school
                        to the senior high school level. Given the difficulties involved in having committed
                        senior high teachers, we thought to stop at the 9th-grade level and add a
                        vocational school. So far, we have built an eight-classroom structure for
                        vocational studies, where we offer Catering, Drafting, Light-duty Mechanics,
                        Electricity, Event Decoration, Computer, and Tailoring. Our vocation teachers are
                        from the Booker Washington Institute, which is believed to be the best vocational
                        Institute in the Republic of Liberia.</p>

                        <p class="sample-text mb-3">Our dreams and aspirations are that, as a child gets to middle school, they should
                        have a sense of responsibility to contribute to the community, society, and the
                        nation, and not become a liability. The vocation starts from the 4 th  grade when
                        students start to identify what they want to be and live their lives off. We also do
                        various kinds of sport, as we believe that all of these make the child physically fit
                        for the world.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-heading">Present Positon</h3>
                        <p class="sample-text mb-3">Currently, the Christiana Bedell Preparatory School has acquired and occupied a
                        1.1 acre of land. On this property we have four buildings that jointly have a total
                        of twenty two class rooms that are used for both academic and vocation studies;
                        one teacher Launch, six administrative offices, two storage rooms, fifteen
                        bathrooms for both students and staff, a big playground for outdoor activities,
                        and a security post. Our entire is enclosed by a twelve feet high concrete fence
